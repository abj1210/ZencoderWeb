/**
 * Implements Huffman coding for data compression. This class constructs a Huffman tree
 * based on the frequency of input words and provides methods to encode and decode words
 * using the generated tree.
 *
 * The Huffman tree is built using a priority queue, where nodes with lower frequencies
 * are prioritized. Each leaf node represents a word, and internal nodes represent combined
 * frequencies of their children. The tree structure enables efficient encoding and decoding
 * of words into bit streams.
 *
 * The class supports tail code assignment for internal nodes, which can be used when the
 * bit stream ends prematurely during decoding. This feature requires the tree to be fully
 * initialized with tail codes.
 *
 * The `getStringBitStream` method encodes a given word into a bit stream by traversing the
 * tree from the leaf node to the root. The `cutWord` method decodes a bit stream back into
 * a word by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node. If tail code support is
 * enabled and the bit stream ends prematurely, the method returns the word associated with
 * the current node.
 *
 * The nested `Node` class represents individual nodes in the Huffman tree. Each node stores
 * a word, its frequency, and references to its parent and child nodes. Nodes are comparable
 * based on their frequency, which is used to maintain the priority queue during tree construction.
 *
 * This class implements the Serializable interface, allowing the Huffman tree to be serialized
 * and deserialized for storage or transmission.
