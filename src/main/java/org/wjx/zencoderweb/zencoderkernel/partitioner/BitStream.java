/**
 * Represents a stream of bits stored as a sequence of boolean values.
 * Provides methods for manipulating the bit stream, including pushing, popping,
 * appending, and converting to and from byte arrays.
 * <p>
 * The class supports operations such as retrieving the first bit, checking if the stream is empty,
 * determining the size of the stream, and cutting overlapping prefixes with another bit stream.
 * Additionally, it allows recovery of bits at the front and provides a string representation of the bit sequence.
 * <p>
 * BitStream can be initialized either as an empty stream or from a byte array, where each byte is expanded into
 * its individual bits in big-endian order.
 * <p>
 * The cut operation removes matching prefixes between two bit streams until a mismatch is found or one of the streams
 * becomes empty. The append operation transfers all bits from another bit stream to the end of this stream.
 * <p>
 * Note: The internal storage of the bit stream is implemented using a deque of boolean values.
