/**
 * The Partitioner class is responsible for partitioning a set of words into multiple Huffman trees
 * to facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of data. It uses a combination of Huffman coding
 * and probabilistic selection to encode a sequence of words into a bit stream and decode the bit
 * stream back into the original sequence of words.
 * <p>
 * The class initializes a list of Huffman trees based on the input word map and partitions the words
 * into these trees. Each tree is constructed using a subset of the words, and the remaining words
 * are assigned as tail codes to the first tree. This allows for efficient encoding and decoding
 * while maintaining a balance between tree size and code length.
 * <p>
 * The encoding process involves traversing the Huffman trees to determine the most likely next word
 * based on the current word and the bit stream. The decoding process reverses this by reconstructing
 * the bit stream from the sequence of words using the corresponding Huffman trees.
 * <p>
 * The class provides methods for encoding a sequence of words into a bit stream, decoding a bit stream
 * back into a sequence of words, and generating a string representation of the partitioner's state.
