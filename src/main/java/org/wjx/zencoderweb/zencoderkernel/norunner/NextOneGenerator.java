/**
 * The NextOneGenerator class is responsible for generating a WordMap by processing text files
 * located in a specified directory. It utilizes the WordLoader class to extract words from the
 * files and constructs a WordMap where edges represent sequential word relationships.
 *
 * The runGenerator method traverses the given directory, identifies regular files, and processes
 * them to build a WordMap. Words are read sequentially, and edges are added to the WordMap based
 * on their order of appearance. The process continues until all words from the files are processed.
 *
 * If an exception occurs during file traversal or word processing, it is caught and logged. The
 * generated WordMap is returned if successful; otherwise, null is returned.
 *
 * This class assumes that the input files contain valid UTF-8 encoded text and that the words
 * extracted are filtered based on specific criteria (e.g., Unicode script).
