/**
 * A utility class for reading text files encoded in UTF-8 line by line.
 * This class provides a simple interface to open a file and retrieve its content
 * one line at a time. It uses a buffered reader internally to ensure efficient reading.
 * <p>
 * The constructor accepts a file path and initializes the reader with UTF-8 encoding.
 * If the file does not exist or cannot be read, an exception is thrown during initialization.
 * <p>
 * The primary method, getNextLine, retrieves the next available line from the file.
 * When the end of the file is reached, it returns null. Any IOException encountered
 * during reading is propagated to the caller for handling.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be used in scenarios where sequential access to file content
 * is required, such as processing large text files or extracting specific data patterns.
