/**
 * A utility class for loading and retrieving individual words from multiple UTF-8 encoded text files.
 * This class processes lines from the provided files, extracting words that belong to the Han script
 * (commonly used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing systems). It supports sequential reading
 * across multiple files, ensuring continuous word retrieval until all files are exhausted.
 * <p>
 * The class initializes with an array of file paths, opening the first file for reading. When the end
 * of a file is reached, it automatically transitions to the next file in the sequence. Words are extracted
 * line by line, filtering out non-Han characters to ensure only relevant content is returned.
 * <p>
 * The primary method, getNextWord, provides access to individual words in sequence. If no words are
 * available in the current line or file, the method handles transitioning to the next line or file
 * internally. When all files have been processed and no more words remain, an IOException is thrown
 * to indicate the end of available content.
 * <p>
 * This class relies on the UTF8Reader utility for efficient line-by-line reading of UTF-8 encoded files.
 * It is designed for scenarios where selective extraction of specific character sets from large text
 * files is required, such as linguistic analysis or data preprocessing tasks.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions related to file access, unsupported encodings, or unexpected I/O errors are propagated
 * to the caller for handling. Proper error handling is essential when using this class to manage
 * resources and respond to potential issues during file processing.
