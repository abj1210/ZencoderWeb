/**
 * The Zencoder class provides functionality for encryption and decryption of data
 * using AES algorithms, as well as encoding and decoding through a custom partitioning mechanism.
 * It integrates with a Partitioner to encode and decode data into a sequence of words,
 * which can be used for obfuscation or compression purposes.
 * <p>
 * The class supports both AES-based encryption/decryption and non-AES encoding/decoding.
 * AES operations require a SecretKey and an initialization vector (IV) for security.
 * Non-AES methods rely solely on the Partitioner for encoding and decoding bit streams.
 * <p>
 * The generateKey method facilitates the creation of AES keys with specified key sizes.
 * The encrypt and decrypt methods handle AES encryption and decryption, respectively,
 * while also leveraging the Partitioner for additional encoding or decoding.
 * <p>
 * The encryptWithoutAES and decryptWithoutAES methods provide encoding and decoding
 * capabilities without involving AES encryption, relying only on the Partitioner's logic.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed for scenarios where data needs to be securely encrypted or
 * transformed into a different representation for storage or transmission.

     * The partitioner is an instance of the Partitioner class, which is responsible for organizing words into multiple
     * Huffman trees to facilitate efficient encoding and decoding of data. It partitions a set of words into these trees,
     * where each tree is constructed using a subset of the words. Remaining words are assigned as tail codes to the first
     * tree, ensuring a balance between tree size and code length.
     * <p>
     * This partitioner is utilized by the containing class to manage encoding and decoding operations. It provides methods
     * for encoding a sequence of words into a bit stream and decoding a bit stream back into the original sequence of words.
     * The encoding process involves probabilistic selection based on the current word and the bit stream, while the decoding
     * process reconstructs the bit stream from the sequence of words using the corresponding Huffman trees.
     * <p>
     * The partitioner's configuration, including the number of Huffman trees and their sizes, is determined during initialization
     * based on the provided word map and partitioning parameters. This allows for efficient and flexible encoding and decoding
     * operations tailored to the specific dataset.
